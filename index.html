an array like object is any object that has a .length property but not available methods.  a stirng is array-like, 

search takes in a string and matches it.  reports back the index number of the start and returns -1 if nothing.  Doesn't keep running.
Match will search as well, but will return an array and you can tell it with flags like g and i.  comes back null.

let promise = new promise(re)

consuming code: is waiting for the producing code to return the code, but to avoid them having to wait wondering, and the poducer being annoyed 
they create a subsciription list that will give the people the song when it is ready

you interact with collections with methods

it is unopinionated.  not required as express has it now

npm install mongodb --save
const mon= require('mongodb').MONGOCLIENT

MONGOCLIENT.connect(script key, err,client)

--save saves it to depenedencies needed for production
--save dev saves it to depenencies for development only


a promise represents a value that will be resolved now, somepoint in the future or never.
.then method sets up callbacks to deal with the resolving of it or the rejection
commonly used for asynchronous tasks like reading files, querying databases, http request

broken up into databases which can have permissions and configs about who can access
collections are within the database and they seperate documents into different categories
documents contain the data with key:value pairs which can be queried with methods

audio controls loop preload="metadata, none, " volume ="0.5" muted

flexible media automatically resizes to fit the container based on the different screen sizes.
This is important as website are being accessed on all different screen sizes.
width:100%, heigh

rm -rf directory name

rmdir
git init

the parameter name does not matter, it's the order in which it is put into the function.
It is good practice though to do this.

Important for object destructiong when you want to take properties/values out of a object and store in a varaiba
also important for default paramters

every object has an internal protoype that reference another object that properties and methods can fallback
on the object does not have them.  This is the foundation of OOP
allows for code reuse and OOP programming patterns

a for loop is a execution of flow that repeatedly exeutes a block of code for a specified number of times.
initial, conditional, update

localStorage.setItem()

control flow structures are programming mechanisms that allow you to control
the order in which statements are executed within a program

object.entries creates an array of the key-v
alue pair within an array
obect.keys: creates an array of the properties
object.assign: cpys values and properties from one o rmore source objects to a target object

too speciic of selectors
using * universal selector too much
not using shorthand properties
using the bang too much
getting rid of css that is outdated or not being used

unuitilized css
too many font sizes and colors

too specific of selectors
universal selector and bang
too many font sizes and colors
not utilizing shorthand properties
leaving in unuititlized css

it is a good idea to put css in the head of the html document, because as the html is being parsed you want the css
to be loaded at the same time so there are no flashes of unstyled content for the user to see.
Putting JS scripts at the end of the body helps to avoid blocking the critical rendering path for the web page to load
overall both help to improve the overall user exprience.

z index is a css property that can be used on positioned elements, and deal with how elements overlay one another along the z index.
This is important when using elements like nav bars with drop down menus as they should appear in front of the other content.
This stacking context is formed with the element being positioned absolute, fixed, sticky or relative.  Then when it is given a zindex
the stacking context is formed for it's children?

print, braille, 3d glasses, spech
Media queries extend beyond screens like speech, and print so that the content is optimized for the context in which it is consumed
media queries has other properties like speech and print which allow for the content to be optimized in the context it which it is to be consumed.

faster development, more efficienct, allowing for more structured code
variables and mixins, nesting, functions and 

yes grid layouts allow for building out robust, complex responsive web sites that are consistent across different devices and screen sizes
<!-- -->

more organized, more efficient

read - get
create - post
update - put
delete - delete

npm install body-parser
const bodyParser= require('bodyParser')

Javascript object notation - it is like an object but key and values are wrapped
in quotes

keep selectors short because as they become more specific it requires
all other selectors to be more specific,
allows for more efficiency, ineherata

object.entries builds an array of key-value in an array
object.keys - builds an array of properties
object.assign - combines objects into one used for cloning

resetting resets all of the css defaults so you have to upload all of your own, where normalize seeks to standardize the defualts across the different browsers so 
you don't have to recreate as many

it adds it to the scripts in the json package and you can run it with the command line

start attribute tells what number for the list to start, can also do reverse
can also do type like A a, i I

no css and html are mark up languages.  They say what should be done
html deals with content and structure and css does styles
JS tells it how it should be done, javasscript
can manipulate data, perform computations, store variables
logic handling like conditionals and switch 

the only media query is a new media query paramater that
certain browsers don't recognize, it 

global object prototype is a built in object to Javascript 
that contains properties and methods like numbers,booleans
