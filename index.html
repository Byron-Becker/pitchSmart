an array like object is any object that has a .length property but not available methods.  a stirng is array-like, 

search takes in a string and matches it.  reports back the index number of the start and returns -1 if nothing.  Doesn't keep running.
Match will search as well, but will return an array and you can tell it with flags like g and i.  comes back null.

let promise = new promise(re)

consuming code: is waiting for the producing code to return the code, but to avoid them having to wait wondering, and the poducer being annoyed 
they create a subsciription list that will give the people the song when it is ready

you interact with collections with methods

it is unopinionated.  not required as express has it now

npm install mongodb --save
const mon= require('mongodb').MONGOCLIENT

MONGOCLIENT.connect(script key, err,client)

--save saves it to depenedencies needed for production
--save dev saves it to depenencies for development only


a promise represents a value that will be resolved now, somepoint in the future or never.
.then method sets up callbacks to deal with the resolving of it or the rejection
commonly used for asynchronous tasks like reading files, querying databases, http request

broken up into databases which can have permissions and configs about who can access
collections are within the database and they seperate documents into different categories
documents contain the data with key:value pairs which can be queried with methods

rm -rf directory name

rmdir
git init

the parameter name does not matter, it's the order in which it is put into the function.
It is good practice though to do this.

Important for object destructiong when you want to take properties/values out of a object and store in a varaiba
also important for default paramters

every object has an internal protoype that reference another object that properties and methods can fallback
on the object does not have them.  This is the foundation of OOP
allows for code reuse and OOP programming patterns
